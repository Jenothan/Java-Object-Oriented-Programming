# Java-Object-Oriented-Programming

Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Abstraction



This repo I made for my java oop learning practice. I am still beginner so I try to write simple programs and understand the basic idea of object oriented concept. In this place I try many topics like class and object creation, how constructor working, using inheritance for reuse, polymorphism for different behavior, also encapsulation and abstraction little bit. Code is not very perfect or professional level, but I just want to keep small examples so I can remember later when I forgot.



Sometimes my code have spelling mistake or variable name funny, but main thing is I slowly getting the point how oop working in real program. I also mix comments in code to explain me what is happening step by step. This is not project for others, this is more like my notebook in coding form. If anyone look at this and learn also it is good, but my main goal is just learn by myself.
